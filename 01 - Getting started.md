# 1 - Getting Started

Welcome! This guide will teach you how to write computer programs in the C programming language. It is targeted at people who already know at least the basics of Python.

First, a little background on C. C was created in 1973 by AT&T, the American equivalent of Telstra. C is usually considered the fastest language around, and used to write almost everything: from video games to desktop applications, to the operating systems themselves (i.e. Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, iOS, Android are all mostly written in C). Many other languages are themselves written in C, such as Python (another language taught at Computer Club). C is not the youngest language by any means, but it is still the most popular language currently in use, narrowly edging out Java - a name you may be familiar with because of its frequent annoying updates.

So, now that you are up to date on the C gossip, let's get to learn the language! Not so fast there, however, as with learning anything, you need the right tools. Unfortunately, when using C this process changes depending on what operating system you are using. So, what I'm going to do is guide you through each process, and you can pick whichever one is relevant to you, OK? OK! Here we go:

## Windows
Most of you are probably using Windows. Unfortunately, Windows is a bit more complicated to use than Os X and Linux, so if you can use either of those then you will probably be better off. However, if you are stuck stuck on Windows, here are the instructions for you. Head [here](https://msys2.github.io) and download either the 32 bit or 64 bit versions, depending on whichever version of Windows you have (hint: i686 means 32 bit). Then, follow the instructions on their page. When a windows with a black background and white text opens, type in `pacman -Syu` and press enter. You will need to type in `Y` and press enter. When it is done (your name will appear in green) close the window and reopen it (you can open  it by searching "MSYS" in the start menu). This time, type in `pacman -S gcc make` and press enter (you will need to type `Y` and hit enter again). You have successfully installed the compiler and build system!

Only step left is to install an editor. The Computer Club recommendation is [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/download). Install that and you are finished! You are ready to go to the next tutorial, located in "02 - Do you see the C.md".

## Mac
A Mac user, eh? Fine by me, let's get started. The first thing you need to do is download a compiler. A compiler is something that turns source code into a program. Apple supplies a package that contains everything you need to start using C. Simply open a Terminal window (use spotlight and search "Terminal". It is the black square icon. We will be using it a lot, so it would be useful to drag it onto your dock) and type `xcode-select --install` then hit enter. A window will come up, click "Install". And you’re done! Well, you still have to wait for a bit for it to download, but then you’re done.

Actually, wait, hold on, there's one more thing you need to install. An editor. It will help you write in the C language. I recommend TextMate, as it is completely free and a pretty good editor. [Here is a link](https://api.textmate.org/downloads/release). You might need to extract it, which you can do by double clicking. You can drag the app to your Applications folder, and you're done! You are ready to go to the next tutorial, located in "02 - Do you see the C.md".

## Ubuntu or Debian
Linux? Awesome! That makes you a Real Programmer. For you, the install process is very, very simple. In fact, it is one command in the terminal. All you have to do is open a Terminal - press Control + Alt + T - and type `sudo apt-get install gcc make gedit -y`. It will ask you for your password, type it in (don't worry if it doesn't show up on the screen) and hit enter. You're done! That's it! You are ready to go to the next tutorial, located in "02 - Do you see the C.md".
